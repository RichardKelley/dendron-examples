**Dendron is a library for building software agents using behavior trees and language models.**

## Dependencies

You will need to install dendron, of course. You can do this via

```
pip install dendron
```

## Example Applications

### Tutorial 1: A Chat Agent

The content of Tutorial 1 can be found in the `tutorial_1` directory.  Following the tutorial you will build a example behavior tree that implements a chat agent. This agent listens to a human via microphone, performs automatic speech recognition (ASR), uses a chat model to generate a response, and plays the audio of that response using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. All locally, using models downloaded from Hugging Face:
